# Donors increasingly investing in Open Educational resources

The ever-increasing collection of open educational resources has created fertile ground for improving learning worldwide, especially where funds for reading materials is scarce. In today’s digital era, openly licensed educational materials can now contribute to making education more accessible to children across the globe.

Based on this fact, a growing global set of movements have begun advocating to eliminate the barriers that restrict access to educational content.  Among these movements, is the call for is Open Educational Resources which proposes alternate models for producing and sharing copyrighted materials based on the fundamental belief that sharing knowledge can promote equity in learning opportunities.

Donors and international organizations are increasingly investing in OER approaches, as they are interested in ensuring that the funded educational materials reach the greatest number of learners. They are also eager to see this broad access to materials is not compromised at the conclusion of the life of the project when there is no longer any mechanism to reproduce the resources.

From a host country government’s perspective, maintaining control over curriculum materials is a strategic approach to curb education expenditure. As openly licensed resources provide a system of achieving all of these objectives, many donors, such as U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), now require its implementing partners to issue all developed learning materials under Creative Commons licenses.
