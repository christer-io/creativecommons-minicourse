# Choosing a Creative Commons license 

Creative Commons licenses give creators and users of information more freedom, through legally viable copyright assertions which clearly define the extent to which the information can be used. Thus, Creative Commons licenses allow the author, as a creator of content, to be precise about how others may, and may not, use their work. Therefore, the licenses are flexible enough to allow the owner of the copyright to determine exactly what is or is not allowed.

There are different options for Creative Commons licenses which all allow or disallow varying levels of restriction. 

The explanations of the six CC licenses, according to the Creative Commons webpage are as follows:  
**Attribution CC BY:** This license allows others to distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon work, even commercially, as long as they credit you the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

**Attribution-ShareAlike CC BY-SA:** This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit the original creator and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on the original will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.
